# Dari Dictionary

Dari Dictionary is an open-source project, that strives to be the first comprehensive English-to-Dari dictionary.

Since Dari meanings are hard to come by you will find a mix of farsi words among the definitions. We are hoping that with the help of the community we will be able to convert those words to their Dari equivalent.
